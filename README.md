# AI-models-for-bug-prediction

## Introduction:
Software Bug Prediction is an important issue in software development and maintenance processes, which concerns with the overall of software success.   This is because predicting the software faults in earlier phase improves the software quality, reliability, efficiency and reduces the software cost. Bug prediction also involves risk analysis, quality of code  etc.

-------------------
## Research and discussed methodologies or approaches:
In this project, Different approaches are studied and discussed. Some of them are:<br>
1. Performance Analysis using Software features at Component(file) level:
2. Rule based approach for Quality of a Software.
3. Bug prediction at method level
4. Bug prediction using Abstract syntax tree(AST)
5. Risk code analysis Using Control flow graph(CFG)
6. Vulnerabilities detection in Software
7. Predicting Bug risk with git metadata
8. Bug hotspots based on commit history.

## Software metrics or features description:
 A software metric is a measure of software characteristics that are quantifiable or countable. It includes McCabe metrics, Halstead features , simple static code measures.

## Packages Used:
- Different packages are explored in this project such as pycallgraph, radon, multimetric, gitrisky etc..
- Radon and multimetic comes handy for extracting software metrics from the software repository.

a.	Software bug prediction at component level.
b.	Rule Based approach for bug prediction
